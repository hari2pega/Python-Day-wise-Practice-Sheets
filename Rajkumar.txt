     Denying work allocated to you on AH project team by quoting this email discussion is not acceptable. Work with AH team members on project deliverables.

                Due to current demand in project, we cannot release you until we get new jonnies.

Hi Raj, 

Almost 8 days completed on my concern, but there is no action taken even I am following up everyday. Earlier you only told me you are going to initiate few weeks release plan but now you are changing your words there is a dependency its not acceptable.

As you know my Primary skill is Cognos BI (Reporting), I don't have Hands on experience or knowledge in Informatica (ETL Tool), but you have allocated informatica project. Even though KT also not completed in AH project, How come you are expecting deliverables from my end with out much knowledge about the Project/Tool -- scope/objective.

Have you arranged any special Training on Informatica Technology?

I already told you clearly multiple times my parents are more worried and they need my attention and they want my stay with them. Since my father is diabetic and I do not want to take any risk in this situation.

As I am the only one Son I have to take care of my parents at this critical situation and they are more worried about this issues.

One of the HCL tagline/value/trait is - Employee is first preference always, But Is this the respect you are giving to Employee/Resource in HCL? 

I believe you can understand my family issue taking that into consideration. So please release me from this account as earliest.

Regards, 
Harish

My parents are dependent on me and they need my support in this critical situation, hence I am not able to concentrate/focus on other things.
